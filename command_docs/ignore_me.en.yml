  help: |
    Running this command stops NQN from reposting any of your messages in any server you share with the bot.
    - Commands are still enabled, running this command again returns you to normal
    - You can still repost messages through our [dashboard](https://nqn.blue)
    - The bot will not respond to any messages you send that would be reposted through a webhook
